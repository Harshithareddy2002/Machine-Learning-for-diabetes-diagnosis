# Machine Learning for Diabetes Diagnosis

## Project Overview
This project implements **Machine Learning** techniques to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset is originally from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**. Three classification algorithms are used:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**

The project also includes **data visualization** techniques to analyze and interpret the dataset effectively.

## Features Implemented
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Model Training & Evaluation  
✅ Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)  
✅ Model Comparison (Accuracy & Confusion Matrix)  
✅ Feature Importance Analysis

## Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed and run the following command:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Project
Execute the Python script to train models and generate visualizations:
```sh
python machine_learning_for_diabetes_diagnosis_.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple diagnostic features used to predict diabetes. The features include:
- **Pregnancies**
- **Glucose Level**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Insulin Level**
- **BMI**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**
- **Age**

The **target variable** indicates whether the patient has diabetes (**1**) or not (**0**).
